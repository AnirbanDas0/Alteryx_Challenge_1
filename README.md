Alteryx Challenge 1
I am starting a weekly Alteryx Challenge series on my LinkedIn page. Each week, I will be diving into a new data set and using the Alteryx platform to analyze it and uncover insights. I'll be sharing my findings and the techniques I used, as well as any challenges I encountered. This is a great opportunity for anyone looking to improve their data analysis skills and learn more about the Alteryx platform. Follow me to stay updated and join in on the challenge! #AlteryxChallenge #DataAnalysis #WeeklyChallenge.



Challange #1 :  Using the data provided in the start file, create an ordered list of the provided unofficial holidays.
